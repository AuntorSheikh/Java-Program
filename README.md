Question: Write a method to sort a three-dimensional integer array. The method should take a three-dimensional integer array and return a new three-dimensional integer array where the original array is sorted. The original array that is passed must not be modified. The new array must have the same dimensions as the original array.

Question2: A Person class has 6 data fields. Name, Father’s name, Mother’s name, Date of Birth, Nationality and an ID.

d) Date of Birth can be any value between 01/01/1940 to present date.
e) Name lengths can be at most 30 characters.
f) Person class will have two constructors.
g) The default constructor will assign random values to every field except for Nationality and ID. ID will automatically be updated when an object is created.
h) Parameterized constructor will assign custom values to the corresponding fields.
i) The class needs to have appropriate getter and setter methods.
j) Data fields should be encapsulated.

Tasks: A) Create an array that holds 20 objects of Person class. Each person object must be created using the default constructor. Display the array contents.
B) Swap the object at array index 7 with a Person object with non-parameterized constructor.
C) Display the array contents.
